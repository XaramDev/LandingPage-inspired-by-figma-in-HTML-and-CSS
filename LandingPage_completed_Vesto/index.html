                <p>† SIPC insurance protects against the loss of cash and securities held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage firm. The limit of SIPC protection is $500,000, which includes a <br>$250,000 limit for cash. SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of your securities, or losses due to bad or inappropriate investment advice. More information is available on the  <br>www.sipc.org. Customers may additionally opt into two additional FDIC sweep products, available through BNY Mellon's partner bank network and through R&T Deposit Solutions, providing $2.5M in <br>extended FDIC insurance each ($5M in total insurance). FDIC coverage through BNY Mellon, member FDIC, protects against the loss of cash deposits held by a customer in the event an FDIC <br>member bank fails. FDIC insurance covers all types of deposits at an insured bank but does not cover investments, even if they were purchased at an insured bank. More information is available on <br>www.fdic.gov.</p>
